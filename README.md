GmailSender
-----------

GmailSender is an iOS tweak that allows you to specify From addresses for Gmail accounts.

No new icons are added to your home screen - you can find the new "From" field in your Gmail account in the Settings app.  Specify multiple senders separated by a space, if you like.

This tweak affects apps that use the normal iOS mail support, such as the built-in Mail app.  It does not affect the Gmail app.
